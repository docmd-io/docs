# LLM Support Plugin

The `llms` plugin generates a standardized `/llms.txt` file at the root of your site. This file is becoming a standard for helping AI agents (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor) discover and read your documentation context efficiently.

## Installation

This plugin is included in `@docmd/core` but must be enabled in your config.

## Configuration

Add `llms` to your `docmd.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: 'https://mysite.com', // REQUIRED
  plugins: {
    llms: {} // Enable with default settings
  }
};
```

### Options

Currently, the plugin uses your existing `siteTitle`, `description`, and page frontmatter to generate the file.

### Excluding Pages

To prevent a specific page from appearing in the AI context file, add this to the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Internal Draft"
llms: false
---
```

## Output Example

The generated `llms.txt` will look like this:

```md
# My Project Documentation

> Generated by docmd

This is the main description of my project.
